I'm a full stack software engieer with a passion for learning. Forever wishing for just a few more hours in the day to check out something new.

- üå± I‚Äôm currently working as a software engineer at [Lever](https://www.lever.co/), an awesome company that builds products that aim to develop genuine relationships with recruitment candidates
- React ‚öõÔ∏è has my heart, but Vue has become a close second. I like to try a lot of different things and have breadth of knowledge.
- üõí I am also a Shopify Partner/Theme Developer, and love to bring my clients onto the Shopify platform.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I am a major foodie üç¥ and have a running list of Michelin restaurants I want to go to with my amazing partner
